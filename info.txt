The egg files are contained in the models folder, and reference the texture contained in the textures folder 
(which is another folder in the art folder, same level as models).

The door isn't yet animated, the animation for it would most likely be saved as just a seperate .egg file.

If there are any conflicts between wall_door_1 (wall piece that has a spot missing for door) and 
door_1 (the actual door piece) since they overlap 1 unit (in a system where 10 units = 1 tile),
let me know.  The graphics where they overlap might bounce back and forth a bit if viewed from different
angles, and if that happens I could just move the small wall piece on the door_1 file inward a little.

The wall tile can be rotated to be used for the floors and ceilings, until individual tiles for those are made.

The way the tile system works for these pieces is that each tile is essentially a 10x10 unit grid.
Every wall is indented half a unit (.5) from the edge, and doors are placed with 3 units on either side and
take up 4 units.

We need to pick out which texture we want to use for the concrete walls, either out of the 4 from the thing
I submitted earlier or I can possibly make a new one.  Until then concrete2 is just set as default.

Also, I plan on making fluorescent ceiling lights, chairs, beds, tables, and some seperate ceiling/floor
tiles, as well as some different wall tiles that have the decals and such.

If you have any questions, let me know.
