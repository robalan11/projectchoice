Prisoner One: Hell yeah, reinforcements!
Listen up, we got screws armed to the teeth,
and...hey, what's he doing here?
Prisoner Two: What, the Cobra? He's the guy who got us here?
Prisoner One: Bull. He smoked my buddy Tony back at Block A.
Prisoner Two: Well, he musta had a good reason, then.
Prisoner One: Well, I got a good reason to let him hit the screws, then. 
Have fun, Cobra. Me and your buddies will hold up here.
You guys got a problem with that?
