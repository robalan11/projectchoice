Prisoner One: Freeze!
You ain't getting past here, smokey!
Prisoner Two: Hey, it’s the Cobra. He’s cool, man.
Musta blown away those screws on the other side of that gate, huh?
Prisoner One: If he’s so cool,
then let him cap those guys holding us down.
Prisoner Two: Hey, that’s a good idea. Cobra, can you
smoke those guys at the corner of A&B? Thanks, man.
