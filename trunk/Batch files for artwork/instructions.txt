export.bat :  exports a maya file to the .egg format, only used to save the model itself and not animation sets.
view_egg.bat : takes a .egg file and shows it in pview.

For both batch files, just drop the proper file type on top of it (ex. drag and drop a maya .mb on top of export.bat, drag and drop a .egg onto view_egg.bat)

These don't have to be in the actual game folder of course, just useful to have if people need them.
